<h1>Crash Online</h1>
<p>Crash Online was the provisory title to what may have been Crash's first ever videogame for the PC. It was first mentioned in a brief article published by Kotaku back in 2006 about Vivendi Games' annual plans, which included Sierra Online at the time. However, just like most other games mentioned in the same article, it never saw the light of day.

To this day, nothing has really surfaced about this mysterious game and the premise or the genre is completely unknown. The obvious title suggests some form of online gameplay integrity. The only sign of its existence left is the tiny logo that can be seen below.

This is what Sierra Online had to say about Crash Online back in 2006:

Initial releases focus on original, catalog and licensed short-session games (West); In mid-session the focus is on FreeStyle (West) and Crash (China).

FreeStyle is a Korean game that Sierra Online was bringing to the US at the time, so this would possibly mean that Crash Online was to be focused on China and the rest of Asia, or more likely, was going to be exclusive to it.

To this day, even the genre of the game remains unknown as well. It is safe to say, that we are most likely to never learn more about Crash Online and its plans.</p>
